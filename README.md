# Introduction
The backend service is deployed on Heroku at: https://simpul-chatkitty.herokuapp.com.

The frontend side is deployed with Vercel at: https://simpul-chatkitty.vercel.app/.

# Usage
When using a new username, an account will automatically be created. When using an existing username, the app will attempt to log in to that user's account.

In this app, there is one global chatroom for all new users. Users can then create private chatrooms by giving the chatroom a name and passing the correct username of their friends.
